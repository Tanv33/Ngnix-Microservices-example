# Ngnix Microservices Example 

I have set up a simple microservices architecture using Nginx as a reverse proxy. Within this architecture, I have created three separate Node.js services: OMS (Order Management System), eCommerce, and Auth (Authentication). Each of these services will be containerized and run using Docker.





## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Tanv33/Ngnix-Microservices-example.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Ngnix-Microservices-example
```

Start the server

```bash
  docker compose up
```
